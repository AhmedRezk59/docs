# How to install an SSL certificate and enable HTTPS?

HTTPS is a protocol for securely communication over networks. It's recommended
best security practice to use it on all sites nowadays, especially when dealing
with logins, e-commerce, or similarly vulnerable data transactions.

An SSL certificate also seals the ownership of a webpage and the responsible
instances for the domain that utilizes the SSL certificate.

SSL adds both security and authenticity to your website or web application.
