# Encryption, Hashing, Encoding and Obfuscation

The following terms have different meaning and are often confused. Cryptography
is a very complex and large field. It is good to know more about it, however for
professional reinventing of cryptographic algorithms it is best to be left to
professionals only.

**Encryption** changes data in such a way that it can be converted back with a right
key.

**Hashing** changes data in a way that it cannot be converted back to the original.
Hashing is commonly used for storing passwords. Application doesn't need to know
the plain password to operate successfully.

**Encoding** is explained here only for better overview. It has nothing to do with
the cryptographic algorithms directly. Encoding is transforming data so that they
can be properly read by different systems and applications.

**Obfuscation** is converting data so that it can be harder to read or reverse
engineered.
