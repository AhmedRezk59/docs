# C editors and IDEs

You can write C programs in practically any text editor or IDE. Using a text editor
instead of an IDE is advised at the beginning so you can fully understand the
compilation process and all the magic happening behind. In this course you can
use any editor you prefer.

## Editors

Some editor examples:

* [Atom editor](https://atom.io/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

## IDEs

Some IDE examples:

* [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)
* [CodeLite](https://codelite.org/)
* [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org/)

Difference between editor and IDE is in their functionalities. IDEs provide more
functionality compared to editors, such as code refactoring, building and compiling
projects, and similar. In editors you will many times need to use tools from the
command line.
