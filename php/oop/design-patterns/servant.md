# Servant design pattern in PHP

Servant design pattern is a behavioral design pattern where multiple classes
use the servant's class behavior to **avoid repeating code**
(*see: [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)*).
Behavior functionality is defined only in one place: In servant.

The servant design pattern is not a defined pattern in the Gang of Four (GoF)
book. It is very similar to the
[command design pattern](/php/oop/design-patterns/command.md)
but with a somewhat different solution to the problem.
