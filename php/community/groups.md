# PHP community and PHP user groups

![PHP User Groups](https://assets.php.earth/docs/community/php-user-groups.png "PHP User Groups")

One of the main advantages of using PHP is its **awesome**, large and diverse
community behind it. The community consists of PHP libraries, frameworks, CMSes
and other PHP applications and also great, open minded people that are connected
with each other one way or another.

## PHP UG concept

PHP User Group (PUG) is virtual or real in-place community consisting of local
people participating and organizing PHP conferences and meetings. You can find
your local user group at official [PHP user groups list][php-net-ug] which is
based on the [PHP.ug][php-ug]. In case there is no local PHP User Group near you,
find some friends interested in PHP and start your own local user group.

Many meetup and conference organizers use also [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/)
for organizing and sharing PHP meetings.
