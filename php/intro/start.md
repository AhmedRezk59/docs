# Getting started

## What is PHP?

PHP is a widely used, general purpose, open source scripting language for writing
web applications, dynamically generated pages and command line interface scripts.

Term *PHP* is a recursive acronym of **P**HP: **H**ypertext **P**reprocessor.
It is not abbreviation. PHP in the beginning stood for **P**ersonal **H**ome
**P**ages and through progress into professional waters it was extended into the
above recursive acronym.

## Why should you learn PHP?

PHP is a great language for web development. It has an enourmous community and
commercial support, finding a quality and affordable hosting is very simple, and
it can be used to power simple websites to professional million users per day
websites.

## What is vanilla PHP?

Later on you will learn how to use package management with Composer, PHP libraries,
frameworks, CMSes (content management systems) and other parts of the PHP ecosystem.
Vanilla PHP in this course means using PHP without any of those 3rd party
libraries or frameworks. Only writing code with the built-in features that PHP
provides out-of-the-box. Vanilla PHP can be also referred to as plain PHP and is
here used as a convenience for understanding what this course is about.

Now let's install PHP. Proceed to the [PHP installation chapter](/php/intro/installation.md)
to get up and running with PHP.
