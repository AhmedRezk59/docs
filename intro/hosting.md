# Which hosting service should I use for PHP? Are there any free hosting providers?

In order for a web application to be able to run on the web (production
environment), you usually choose a hosting service provider with a web server.

## Types of web hosting

### Shared hosting

A shared web hosting service or virtual hosting service is a service where many
websites are hosted on the same webserver, and the server's resources (RAM,
disk, and processor) are shared among the users. PHP settings and installed
extensions are usually the same for all websites. It might be a good option if
you want to get started quickly and painlessly, but still leave the maintaining
and server upgrading to your preferred hosting service.

### VPS

A VPS (virtual private server) is a step up in terms of hosting services. It
can be a bit more pricey than shared hosting, but no other user shares your
package. A VPS can get a dedicated amount of RAM, disk, and processor speed, so
your application is already a step forward in gaining more freedom in its
settings and customizations.

### Dedicated server

A dedicated server means an entire server machine, dedicated for your needs.
More resources and disk quota is available for you when choosing to use a
dedicated server. The price can be high, but flexibility and customization is
at its best. Choose this option if you're an advanced user with system
administration knowledge.

### Collocation

Collocated hosting means that you bring your own hardware to your data center
service provider, and they plug it onto their high speed and availability
network.

### Cloud hosting

This is latest trend in web hosting services with greater flexibility.

## Free PHP hosting

One of the most frequently asked questions is whether there any good, free
providers for hosting PHP applications.

In short, yes, there are, but keep in mind that sooner or later you'll meet
limitations with this approach. Almost nothing is completely free, and the same
is true for web hosting.

Some of the limitations to be aware of:

* Traffic quota limit.
* Server resources quota limit.
* PHP extensions and functionality limitations.
* Forcibly injected advertising.

A quick list of some of free hosting providers to check out:

* [Amazon AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
* [Zeit now](https://zeit.co)
* ...

Do yourself and your application's audience a favor and invest a bit into your
hosting infrastructure. Stability and availability of your application will
depend on a lot on this.
