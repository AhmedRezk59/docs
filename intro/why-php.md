# Why choose PHP?

## PHP compared to other programming languages

A completely normal question to ask yourself when starting a project is which
technologies to use.

Some of the strengths of PHP:

* Good speed and performance.
* Simplicity and the ability to develop complex applications.
* Very vibrant, large, and diverse community.
* Active, updated, and detailed manual.
* A wide selection of out-of-the-box, popular, and production ready open source
  solutions such as content management and e-commerce systems, CRMs,
  frameworks, and components and libraries for building applications from
  scratch.
* PHP is used by [82.1%](https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/programming_language/all)
  of all the websites whose server-side platform could be measured.
