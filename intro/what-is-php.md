# What is PHP? Where Should I Start?

Dear reader, PHP (which stands for recursive backronym of "PHP: Hypertext
Preprocessor") is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language
for writing web applications, dynamically generated pages and command line
interface scripts.

## Where to Start?

If you want to learn PHP and web development as "right way" as possible and
properly, it is very important to gain basic knowledge of mathematics, computer
science, programming in general and similar tech fields before PHP or other
languages should be learned.

PHP is located and best described on the official website [PHP.net](http://php.net)
with updated and in-depth [manual](http://php.net/manual). Reading it is highly
recommended to get to know PHP in details. As you will pass through the manual
pages you will progress with your knowledge. You can start with the
[Simple PHP Tutorial](http://php.net/manual/en/tutorial.php) to get PHP up and
running fast.

Use Google for most obvious issues you will find or ask on forums.

## Where to Go Next?

Another important part of being developer is also to constantly learn and be
updated about new things either from PHP or development and programming in general.
