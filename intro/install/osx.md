## OS X

By default, OS X includes a slightly outdated PHP. To install and use the
latest PHP on OS X, aside from by using one of the aforementioned packages, you
can also use one of the following solutions:

* [Homebrew PHP repository](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-php) for
  [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) package manager.
* [Liip's PHP binary package](http://php-osx.liip.ch/).
* [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) - Package management system provided by
  an open source community initiative.
* [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/) - All-in-one package for OS X (and Windows).
