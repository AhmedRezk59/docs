# PHP evolution

Knowing something about [PHP history](http://php.net/history.php) and about who
initially created the PHP language and started the [PHP](http://php.net)
project is interesting information that might help inspire you for developing
something of your own. It might also help you to better understand the current
state of PHP functionality.

PHP was initially written by **Rasmus Lerdorf**. It all started in 1994 when
Rasmus started working on the very first incarnation of PHP which was a simple
set of Common Gateway Interface (CGI) binaries written in the C programming
language.
