## How to learn?

Learning is an important part of every developer to stay current. Each person has
different preferences and approaches for learning. What is important is that you
keep learning through your entire career. Few suggestions you can implement in
your learning habits: make dedicated time for learning, take small steps, study
each topic in details. Even if it may seem that you will not need particular topic
now, it might be useful later on in some project of yours. Learning has an
advantage where you will be able to recall where to look further again in the
future when you need to solve particular development problem. Many developers
also write blog posts or articles as they learn something new for multiple reasons:
to share the knowledge with others and to strengthen their knowledge on the particular
topic as well (like taking notes when studying for an exam).
