# Docker introduction

Docker provides a way to run applications isolated in containers. Working with
Docker is a really easy and useful habbit, as a developer you should always aim
for the best practices and tools. A portable and flexible virtual environment is
a powerful tool to encapsulate your application or quickly start an other experiment
without overcomlicated development/production server architecture.

## What is Docker?

Docker is the company driving the container movement and the only container
platform provider to address every application across the hybrid cloud. Todayâ€™s
businesses are under pressure to digitally transform but are constrained by
existing applications and infrastructure while rationalizing and increasingly
diverse portfolio of clouds, datacenters and application architectures. Docker
enables true independence between applications and infrastructure and developers
and IT ops to unlock their potential and creates a model for better collaboration
and innovation.

## Installing the service

No mather what is your host system, you can install Docker and you can run any
container in your environment, you can run a Linux container on a Windows and
inside there you can run multiple services for your development. For installing
follow the instructions on the following pages:

* Mac: https://www.docker.com/docker-mac
* Windows Desktop: https://www.docker.com/docker-windows
* Windows Server: https://www.docker.com/docker-windows-server
* Ubuntu: https://www.docker.com/docker-ubuntu
* Debian: https://www.docker.com/docker-debian
* Centos: https://www.docker.com/docker-centos-distribution
* Fedora: https://www.docker.com/docker-fedora

Documentation about installation: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation

## Quickstart

After you installed docker you should able to run `docker` and `docker-compose`
in your terminal/command line tool. For quickly boot up a project you will need
to create one file in your project root folder: `docker-compose.yml` with this
basic configuration:

```yaml
version: '3.4'
services:
  web:
    image: phpearth/php:7.2-apache
    volumes:
      - ./:/var/www/localhost/htdocs
    ports:
      - 8080:80
```

For running it open your project folder in command line and call: `docker-compose up`

It will download the group image and start your server, it will link your project
folder with the default server root and it will bound the server http output to
your machine :8080 port.

After it's started check your http://localhost:8080 url and you should able to
start develop your project.

> Note: You should bound a `src` folder into the container instead the whole project by replacing the `./` to `./src`

For more options check the documentation: https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file
