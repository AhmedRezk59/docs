# Docker for PHP developers

Docker provides a way to run applications isolated in containers. Working with docker is a really easy and useful habbit, as a developer you should always aim for the best practices and tools. A portable and flexible virtual environment is a powerful tool to encapsulate your application or quickly start an other experiment without overcomlicated development/production server architecture.

## What is docker?

Docker is the company driving the container movement and the only container platform provider to address every application across the hybrid cloud. Todayâ€™s businesses are under pressure to digitally transform but are constrained by existing applications and infrastructure while rationalizing and increasingly diverse portfolio of clouds, datacenters and application architectures. Docker enables true independence between applications and infrastructure and developers and IT ops to unlock their potential and creates a model for better collaboration and innovation.
