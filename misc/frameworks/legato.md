## Legato framework!

Legato is a simple yet powerful PHP framework for rapid application development that is suited 
for small to medium scale apps and APIs.

Legato framework is a seamless integration of powerful PHP packages from Symfony Components, 
illuminate, etc. with high performance.

You can already use this MVC framework for small projects or APIs though it is still (WIP).
