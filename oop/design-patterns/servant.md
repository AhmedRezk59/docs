# Servant Design Pattern in PHP

Servant design pattern is behavioral design pattern where multiple classes use
the servant's class behavior. To
[avoid repeating code - DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).
Behavior functionality is defined only in one place - in servant.

The servant design pattern is not a defined pattern in the Gang of Four (GoF)
book. It is very similar to the
[command design pattern](/oop/design-patterns/command.md)
but with a bit different solution to the problem.
