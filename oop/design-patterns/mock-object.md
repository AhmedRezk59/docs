# Mock object design pattern in PHP

Mock objects imitate the behavior of the real objects. They are used in
testing, where creating mock objects makes testing simpler and still provides
the same behavior as the real object used in the application code. They can
also be used as a base while developing a specific part of an application in a
team, without utilizing the entire application.
