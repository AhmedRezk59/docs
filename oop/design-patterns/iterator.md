# Iterator Design Pattern in PHP

Iterator pattern is software design pattern which provides access to the elements
of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
It makes elements appear as a collection of objects.

* Promote to "full object status" the traversal of a collection.
* Polymorphic traversal

## PHP Implementations

* PHP offers [Iterator interface](http://php.net/manual/en/class.iterator.php)
  out of the box. Its SPL library has also a wide variety of
  [useful iterators](http://php.net/manual/en/spl.iterators.php). After
  understanding the basics of the iterator pattern using these instead of
  reinventing the wheel is more convenient.
