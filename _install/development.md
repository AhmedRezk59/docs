## Development on localhost using built-in web server

If you're developing PHP applications on your local workstation, PHP has also a
useful built-in web server for localhost development. It is not intended to be used
for production environment.

Inside your project folder you can run it from the command line using PHP CLI
SAPI:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser to access it.
