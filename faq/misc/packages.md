# Where to find open source PHP libraries, scripts and packages?

Vanilla PHP provides you a lot of features to handle many use cases. However in
order to not repeat yourself, you will soon need more libraries in your PHP
application.

There are many places for you to find open source PHP libraries that you can use
in your code. Today practically all PHP libraries from [GitHub](https://github.com)
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org), and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/explore) can
be found on [http://packagist.org](http://packagist.org).

Packagist is a repository containing open source PHP packages, libraries,
components, frameworks, even all-in-one software solutions such as CMSes,
eCommerce and similar out-of-the-box working projects.

For using packagist you will need to use [Composer](http://getcomposer.org),
command line script for managing dependencies in your project.

Some PHP projects are that big that they have their own *one-place* locations
for their specific extensions, bundles, or plugins - for open source and
proprietary code.
