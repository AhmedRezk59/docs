![What is PHP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/php-earth/assets/master/images/faq/intro/php.png "What is PHP")

PHP (which is a recursive acronym of **P**HP: **H**ypertext **P**reprocessor)
is a widely used, general purpose, open source scripting language for writing
web applications, dynamically generated pages, and command line interface
scripts.

In the beginning PHP was an acronym of **P**ersonal **H**ome **P**ages. Since
PHP is now a fully professional language, it was extended into the recursive
acronym of PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.

## Where to start?

If you want to learn PHP and web development as properly and as "right way" as
possible, it is very important to gain basic knowledge of mathematics, computer
science, programming in general and similar tech fields before learning PHP or
other languages.

PHP is located and best described by the official website
[PHP.net](http://php.net), with an in-depth [manual](http://php.net/manual).
Reading it is highly recommended to get to know PHP in details. As you read
through the manual, your knowledge will progress. You can start with the
"[Simple PHP Tutorial](http://php.net/manual/en/tutorial.php)" to get PHP up
and running fast.

Use Google for the more obvious issues that you're likely to find or ask on
forums.

## PHP installation
