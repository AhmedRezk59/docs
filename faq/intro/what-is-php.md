# What is PHP? Where should I start?

PHP (which is a recursive backronym of "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor") is a
widely used, general purpose, open source scripting language for writing web
applications, dynamically generated pages and command line interface scripts.

## Where to start?

If you want to learn PHP and web development as properly and as "right way" as
possible, it is very important to gain basic knowledge of mathematics, computer
science, programming in general and similar tech fields before learning PHP or
other languages.

PHP is located and best described by the official website
[PHP.net](http://php.net), with an up-to-date and in-depth manual located
[here](http://php.net/manual). Reading it is highly recommended to get to know
PHP in detail. As you read through the manual, your knowledge will progress.
You can start with the "[Simple PHP Tutorial](http://php.net/manual/en/tutorial.php)"
to get PHP up and running fast.

Use Google for the more obvious issues that you're likely to find or ask on
forums.
