number of web sites and web applications developed in PHP. More than 80% of
business web sites run on PHP. It is also a great language to start learning
programming and web development. With PHP you will simultaneusly learn also
other technologies and languages, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, HTTP, SQL,
regex, Bash, and more.
