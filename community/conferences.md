# What are PHP Conferences and Where Can I Attend One?

PHP conferences are PHP specific events, at which established, well known PHP
speakers present their topics and users meet and discuss PHP related topics and
have fun. They occur all over the world in many countries.

[PHP.net](http://php.net) always updates and announces PHP conferences from all
over the world. You can check the list of current conferences happening in the
