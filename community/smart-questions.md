This guide will show you how to ask smart and efficient questions in technical
communities such as this.

## Research the problem

</div>

Read up on the problem before you ask for help. You may be able to save the time
of the helper, and even if your research doesn't answer your questions, you'll be
better able to convey these questions in a better, more sensible manner.

* Look for tutorials
* Do internet research
* Look at answers to other people's questions on forums and answer sites
* Find and read documentation

## Ask the right people

Finding the right channel with the right people is pretty important. Also consider
the complexity of the problem and the skill level of the people you wish to ask.

</div>

## Don't ask to ask

Ask your questions directly and clearly. Don't worry about asking whether it's ok
to ask a question. Any question is welcome, but you may be directed elsewhere if
the question is more appropriate to a different channel.

</div>

## Ask everyone

It's not a good idea to address a question to a specific person, even if they've
helped you in the past. Directed questions are much less likely to be answered
than open questions.

</div>

## Don't ask when busy

Group can sometimes be flooded with questions or chatter. Try to find a different
channel where you can get the attention of people who'll be able to help.

</div>

## Be clear

Make sure you write questions that clearly and concisely communicate the problems
you want solved. This may include program version information and other details
about the system you're using. For sharing code use [nopaste](/interop/nopaste.md).

</div>

## Include purpose

Make sure to include the reason for your question and what you want to achieve
with the answer. This allows the person answering your question to provide the
right solution even when it isn't obvious.

</div>

## Be patient

Wait for an answer. Not all group members are available all the time, but they'll
respond when they can. Saying "thank you" when the question is solved can give a
much better impression about you and help to cultivate warm feelings for those
solving your question.

Keep learning; All experts were once beginners.
